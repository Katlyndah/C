    Arithmetic instruction
int i = (3 * 2) + 1; plus and times are operators and the numbers are operands.

operands can be int, float e.t.c
+ - / * are operants.

e.g
int b = 2, c = 3;
int z = b*c; is legal and won't return an error.
int z; b*c = z; is illegal and will return an error. 

% => modular division operator.
returns the remainder.
cannot be applied on floating point numbers.
%sign is the same as of numerator(-5%/2 = -1)
          ____|____
         |         |
      5%2 = 1    -5%2 = -1

No operator is assumed to be present.
int i = ab  is invalid
int i = a*b is valid!

There is no operator to perform exponentiation in C. However, we can use
pow(x,y) from <math.h> - more later!
